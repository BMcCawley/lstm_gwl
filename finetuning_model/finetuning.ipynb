    "# How-to Finetune\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before we start**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This tutorial is rendered from a Jupyter notebook that is hosted on GitHub. If you want to run the code yourself, you can find the notebook and configuration files [here](https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology/tree/master/examples/06-Finetuning).\n",
    "- To be able to run this notebook locally, you need to download the publicly available CAMELS US rainfall-runoff dataset and a publicly available extensions for hourly forcing and streamflow data. See the [Data Prerequisites Tutorial](data-prerequisites.nblink) for a detailed description on where to download the data and how to structure your local dataset folder. Note the special [section](data-prerequisites.nblink#CAMELS-US-catchment-attributes) with additional requirements for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to adapt a pretrained model to a different, eventually much smaller dataset, a concept called finetuning. Finetuning is well-established in machine learning and thus nothing new. Generally speaking, the idea is to use a (very) large and diverse dataset to learn a general understanding of the underlying problem first and then, in a second step, adapt this general model to the target data. Usually, especially if the available target data is limited, pretraining plus finetuning yields (much) better results than only considering the final target data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The connection to hydrology is the following: Often, researchers or operators are only interested in a single basin. However, considering that a Deep Learning (DL) model has to learn all (physical) process understanding from the available training data, it might be understandable that the data records of a single basin might not be enough (see e.g. the presentation linked at [this](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-8855.html) EGU'20 abstract)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is were we apply the concept of pretraining and finetuning: First, we train a DL model (e.g. an LSTM) with a large and diverse, multi-basin dataset (e.g. CAMELS) and then finetune this model to our basin of interest. Everything you need is available in the NeuralHydrology package and in this notebook we will give you an overview of how to actually do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Finetuning can be a tedious task and is usually very sensitive to the learning rate as well as the number of epochs used for finetuning. One reason is that the pretrained models are usually quite large. In fact, most often they are much larger than what would be possible to train for just a single basin. So during finetuning, we have to make sure that this large capacity is not negatively impacting our model results. Common approaches are to a) only allow parts of the model to be adapted during finetuning and/or b) to train with a much lower learning rate. So far, no publication was published that presents a universally working approach for finetuning in hydrology. So be aware that the results may vary and you might need to invest some time before finding a good strategy. However, in our experience it was always possible to get better results _with_ finetuning than without.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To summarize**: If you are interested in getting the best-performing Deep Learning model for a single basin, pretraining on a large and diverse dataset, followed by finetuning the pretrained model on your target basin is the way to go."

    "## Pretraining\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we need to pretrain our model on a large and possibly diverse dataset. Our target basin does not necessarily have to be a part of this dataset, but usually it should be better to include it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of the demonstration, we will train an LSTM on the CAMELS US dataset and then finetune this model to a random basin. Note that it is possible to use other inputs during pretraining and finetuning, if additional embedding layers (before the LSTM) are used, which we will ignore for now. Furthermore, we will concentrate only on demonstrating the \"how-to\" rather than striving for best-possible performance. To save time and energy, we will only pretrain the model for a small number of epochs. When striving for the best possible performance, you should make sure that you pretrain the model as best as possible, before starting to finetune.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will stick closely to the model and experimental setup from [Kratzert et al. (2019)](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/23/5089/2019/hess-23-5089-2019.html). To summarize:\n",
    "- A single LSTM layer with a hidden size of 128.\n",
    "- Input sequences are 365 days and the prediction is made at the last timestep.\n",
    "- We will use the same CAMELS attributes, as in the publication mentioned above, as additional inputs at every time step so that the model can learn different hydrological behaviors depending on the catchment properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, take a look at the config print-out below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "- The config file assumes that the CAMELS US dataset is stored under `data/CAMELS_US` (relative to the main directory of this repository) or a symbolic link exists at this location. Make sure that this folder contains the required subdirectories `basin_mean_forcing`, `usgs_streamflow` and `camels_attributes_v2.0`. If your data is stored at a different location and you can't or don't want to create a symbolic link, you will need to change the `data_dir` argument in the `531_basins.yml` config file that is located in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "- By default, the config (`531_basins.yml`) assumes that you have a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU (see config argument `device`). In case you don't have any or you have one but want to train on the CPU, you can either change the config argument to `device: cpu` or pass `gpu=-1` to the `start_run()` function. Please note that training such a model on such a large dataset on CPU takes a very long time. "

You can also change the learning rate, loss function, evaluation metrics and so on.

    "So we see roughly the same performance increase in the test period (slightly higher), which is great. However, note that a) our base model was not optimally trained (we stopped quite early) but also b) the finetuning settings were chosen rather randomly. From our experience so far, you can almost always get performance increases for individual basins with finetuning, but it is difficult to find settings that are universally applicable. However, this tutorial was just a showcase of how easy it actually is to finetune models with the NeuralHydrology library. Now it is up to you to experiment with it."
